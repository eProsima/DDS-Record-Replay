DDS Replayer Configuration
==========================

A |ddsreplayer| is configured by a *.yaml* configuration file.
This *.yaml* file contains all the information regarding the DDS interface configuration, playback parameters, and |ddsreplayer| specifications.
Thus, this file has four major configuration groups:

* ``dds``: configuration related to DDS communication.
* ``replayer``: configuration with data playback parameters.
* ``specs``: configuration of the internal operation of the |ddsreplayer|.


.. _replayer_dds_recorder_configuration_dds_configuration:

DDS Configuration
-----------------

Configuration related to DDS communication.

.. _replayer_usage_configuration_domain_id:

DDS Domain
^^^^^^^^^^

Tag ``domain`` configures the :term:`Domain Id`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    domain: 101

.. _replayer_topic_filtering:

Topic Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |ddsreplayer| automatically detects the topics that are being used in a DDS Network.
The |ddsreplayer| then creates internal DDS :term:`Writers<DataWriter>` to replay the data published on each topic.
The |ddsreplayer| allows filtering DDS :term:`Topics<Topic>` to allow users to configure the DDS :term:`Topics<Topic>` that must be replayed.
These data filtering rules can be configured under the ``allowlist`` and ``blocklist`` tags.
If the ``allowlist`` and ``blocklist`` are not configured, the |ddsreplayer| will replayed the data published on every topic it discovers.
If both the ``allowlist`` and ``blocklist`` are configured and a topic appears in both of them, the ``blocklist`` has priority and the topic will be blocked.

Topics are determined by the tags ``name`` (required) and ``type``, both of which accept wildcard characters.

.. note::

    Placing quotation marks around values in a YAML file is generally optional, but values containing wildcard characters do require single or double quotation marks.

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    allowlist:
      - name: AllowedTopic1
        type: Allowed

      - name: AllowedTopic2
        type: "*"

      - name: HelloWorldTopic
        type: HelloWorld

    blocklist:
      - name: "*"
        type: HelloWorld

In this example, the data published in the topic ``AllowedTopic1`` with type ``Allowed`` and in the topic ``AllowedTopic2`` with any type will be replayed by the |ddsreplayer|.
The data published in the topic ``HelloWorldTopic`` with type ``HelloWorld`` will be blocked, since the ``blocklist`` is blocking all topics with any name and with type ``HelloWorld``.

.. _replayer_topic_qos:

Topic QoS
^^^^^^^^^

The following is the set of QoS that are configurable for a topic.
For more information on topics, please read the `Fast DDS Topic <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/dds_layer/topic/topic.html>`_ section.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Quality of Service
        - Yaml tag
        - Data type
        - Default value
        - QoS set

    *   - Reliability
        - ``reliability``
        - *bool*
        - ``false``
        - ``RELIABLE`` / ``BEST_EFFORT``

    *   - Durability
        - ``durability``
        - *bool*
        - ``false``
        - ``TRANSIENT_LOCAL`` / ``VOLATILE``

    *   - Ownership
        - ``ownership``
        - *bool*
        - ``false``
        - ``EXCLUSIVE_OWNERSHIP_QOS`` / ``SHARED_OWNERSHIP_QOS``

    *   - Partitions
        - ``partitions``
        - *bool*
        - ``false``
        - Topic with / without partitions

    *   - Key
        - ``keyed``
        - *bool*
        - ``false``
        - Topic with / without `key <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/dds_layer/topic/typeSupport/typeSupport.html#data-types-with-a-key>`_

    *   - History Depth
        - ``history-depth``
        - *unsigned integer*
        - ``5000``
        - :ref:`replayer_history_depth`

    *   - Max Transmission Rate
        - ``max-tx-rate``
        - *float*
        - ``0`` (unlimited)
        - :ref:`replayer_max_tx_rate`

.. warning::

    Manually configuring ``TRANSIENT_LOCAL`` durability may lead to incompatibility issues when the discovered reliability is ``BEST_EFFORT``.
    Please ensure to always configure the ``reliability`` when configuring the ``durability`` to avoid the issue.

.. _replayer_history_depth:

History Depth
"""""""""""""

The ``history-depth`` tag configures the history depth of the Fast DDS internal entities.
By default, the depth of every RTPS History instance is :code:`5000`, which sets a constraint on the maximum number of samples a |ddsreplayer| instance can deliver to late joiner Readers configured with ``TRANSIENT_LOCAL`` `DurabilityQosPolicyKind <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/dds_layer/core/policy/standardQosPolicies.html#durabilityqospolicykind>`_.
Its value should be decreased when the sample size and/or number of created endpoints (increasing with the number of topics) are big enough to cause memory exhaustion issues.
If enough memory is available, however, the ``history-depth`` could be increased to deliver a greater number of samples to late joiners.

.. _replayer_max_tx_rate:

Max Transmission Rate
"""""""""""""""""""""

The ``max-tx-rate`` tag limits the frequency [Hz] at which samples are sent by discarding messages transmitted before :code:`1/max-tx-rate` seconds have passed since the last sent message.
It only accepts non-negative numbers.
By default it is set to ``0``; it sends samples at an unlimited transmission rate.

.. _replayer_manual_topics:

Manual Topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A subset of QoS can be manually configured for a specific topic under the tag ``topics``.
The tag ``topics`` has a required ``name`` tag that accepts wildcard characters.
It also has two optional tags: a ``type`` tag that accepts wildcard characters, and a ``qos`` tag with the QoS that the user wants to manually configure.
If a ``qos`` is not manually configured, it will get its value by discovery.

**Example of usage**

.. code-block:: yaml

    topics:
      - name: "temperature/*"
        type: "temperature/types/*"
        qos:
          max-tx-rate: 15

.. note::

    The :ref:`Topic QoS <replayer_topic_qos>` configured in the Manual Topics take precedence over the :ref:`Specs Topic QoS <replayer_specs_topic_qos>`.


.. _replayer_ignore_participant_flags:

Ignore Participant Flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A set of discovery traffic filters can be defined in order to add an extra level of isolation.
This configuration option can be set through the ``ignore-participant-flags`` tag:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ignore-participant-flags: no_filter                          # No filter (default)
    # or
    ignore-participant-flags: filter_different_host              # Discovery traffic from another host is discarded
    # or
    ignore-participant-flags: filter_different_process           # Discovery traffic from another process on same host is discarded
    # or
    ignore-participant-flags: filter_same_process                # Discovery traffic from own process is discarded
    # or
    ignore-participant-flags: filter_different_and_same_process  # Discovery traffic from own host is discarded

See `Ignore Participant Flags <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/discovery/general_disc_settings.html?highlight=ignore%20flags#ignore-participant-flags>`_ for more information.


.. _replayer_custom_transport_descriptors:

Custom Transport Descriptors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, |ddsreplayer| internal participants are created with enabled `UDP <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/transport/udp/udp.html>`_ and `Shared Memory <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/transport/shared_memory/shared_memory.html>`_ transport descriptors.
The use of one or the other for communication will depend on the specific scenario, and whenever both are viable candidates, the most efficient one (Shared Memory Transport) is automatically selected.
However, a user may desire to force the use of one of the two, which can be accomplished via the ``transport`` configuration tag.

.. code-block:: yaml

    transport: builtin    # UDP & SHM (default)
    # or
    transport: udp        # UDP only
    # or
    transport: shm        # SHM only

.. warning::

    When configured with ``transport: shm``, |ddsreplayer| will only communicate with applications using Shared Memory Transport exclusively (with disabled UDP transport).


.. _replayer_interface_whitelist:

Interface Whitelist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optional tag ``whitelist-interfaces`` allows to limit the network interfaces used by UDP and TCP transport.
This may be useful to only allow communication within the host (note: same can be done with :ref:`replayer_ignore_participant_flags`).
Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    whitelist-interfaces:
      - "127.0.0.1"    # Localhost only

See `Interface Whitelist <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/transport/whitelist.html>`_ for more information.

Replay Configuration
--------------------

Configuration of data playback settings.


Input File
^^^^^^^^^^

The path to the file, set through the ``input-file`` configuration tag.
When the input file is specified both through CLI argument and YAML configuration file, the former takes precedence.

.. _replayer_replay_configuration_begintime:

Begin Time
^^^^^^^^^^

By default, all data stored in the provided MCAP file is played back.
However, a user might be interested in only replaying data relative to a specific time frame.
``begin-time`` and ``end-time`` configuration options can be leveraged for this purpose, and their format is as follows:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Parameter
        - Tag
        - Description
        - Data type
        - Default value

    *   - Use local time zone
        - ``local``

        - Whether to interpret the provided datetime |br| as local (``true``)
          or as a Greenwich Mean Time |br| (GMT/UTC +0)
          without Daylight Saving Time |br| (DST) considerations (``false``).
        - ``bool``
        - ``true``

    *   - Datetime Format
        - ``format``
        - Format followed by the provided datetime.
        - ``string``
        - ``"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"``

    *   - Datetime
        - ``datetime``
        - Datetime (seconds precision).
        - ``string``
        -

    *   - Milliseconds
        - ``milliseconds``
        - Milliseconds.
        - ``integer``
        - ``0``

    *   - Microseconds
        - ``microseconds``
        - Microseconds.
        - ``integer``
        - ``0``

    *   - Nanoseconds
        - ``nanoseconds``
        - Nanoseconds.
        - ``integer``
        - ``0``

Messages recorded/sent (see :ref:`Log Publish Time <recorder_usage_configuration_logpublishtime>`) before ``begin-time`` will not be played back by a |ddsreplayer| instance.

.. _replayer_replay_configuration_endtime:

End Time
^^^^^^^^

As with ``begin-time``, a user can discard messages recorded/sent after a specific timepoint set through the ``end-time`` tag, which follows the format described in :ref:`Begin Time <replayer_replay_configuration_begintime>`.

.. _replayer_replay_configuration_startreplaytime:

Start Replay Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configuration option (``start-replay-time``) allows to start replaying data at a certain timepoint following the format described in :ref:`Begin Time <replayer_replay_configuration_begintime>`.
If the provided timepoint already expired, the replayer starts publishing messages right away.

.. _replayer_replay_configuration_playbackrate:

Playback Rate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, data is replayed at the same rate it was published/received.
However, a user might be interested in playing messages back at a rate different than the original one.
This can be accomplished through the playback ``rate`` tag, which accepts positive float values (e.g. 0.5 <--> half speed || 2 <--> double speed).

.. _replayer_replay_configuration_replaytypes:

Replay Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, a |ddsreplayer| instance automatically sends all type information found in the provided MCAP file, which might be required for applications relying on :term:`Dynamic Types<DynamicTypes>`.
Nonetheless, a user can choose to avoid this by setting ``replay-types: false``, so only data samples are sent while their associated type information is disregarded.

Specs Configuration
-------------------

The internals of a |ddsreplayer| can be configured using the ``specs`` optional tag that contains certain options related with the overall configuration of the |ddsreplayer| instance to run.
The values available to configure are:

Number of Threads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``specs`` supports a ``threads`` optional value that allows the user to set a maximum number of threads for the internal :code:`ThreadPool`.
This ThreadPool allows to limit the number of threads spawned by the application.
This improves the performance of the internal data communications.

This value should be set by each user depending on each system characteristics.
In case this value is not set, the default number of threads used is :code:`12`.

Wait-for-acknowledgement Timeout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The execution of a |ddsreplayer| instance ends when the last message contained in the provided input file is published (or the user manually aborts the process, see :ref:`replayer_usage_close_replayer`).
Note that this last message might be lost after publication, and if reliable `Reliability QoS <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/dds_layer/core/policy/standardQosPolicies.html#reliabilityqospolicy>`__ is being used, a mechanism should be established to avoid this problematic situation.
For this purpose, the user can specify the maximum amount of milliseconds (``wait-all-acked-timeout``) to wait on closure until published messages are acknowledged by matched readers.
Its value is set to ``0`` by default (no wait).

.. _replayer_specs_topic_qos:

QoS
^^^

``specs`` supports a ``qos`` **optional** tag to configure the default values of the :ref:`Topic QoS <replayer_topic_qos>`.

.. note::

    The :ref:`Topic QoS <replayer_topic_qos>` configured in ``specs`` can be overwritten by the :ref:`Manual Topics <replayer_manual_topics>`.

.. _replayer_specs_logging:

Logging
^^^^^^^

``specs`` supports a ``logging`` **optional** tag to configure the |ddsreplayer| logs.
Under the ``logging`` tag, users can configure the type of logs to display and filter the logs based on their content and category.
When configuring the verbosity to ``info``, all types of logs, including informational messages, warnings, and errors, will be displayed.
Conversely, setting it to ``warning`` will only show warnings and errors, while choosing ``error`` will exclusively display errors.
By default, the filter allows all errors to be displayed, while selectively permitting warning messages from ``DDSPIPE|DDSREPLAYER`` and informational messages from the ``DDSREPLAYER`` category.

.. code-block:: yaml

    logging:
      verbosity: info
      filter:
        error: "DDSPIPE|DDSREPLAYER"
        warning: "DDSPIPE|DDSREPLAYER"
        info: "DDSREPLAYER"

.. note::

    Configuring the logs via the Command-Line is still active and takes precedence over YAML configuration when both methods are used simultaneously.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Logging
        - Yaml tag
        - Description
        - Data type
        - Default value
        - Possible values

    *   - Verbosity
        - ``verbosity``
        - Show messages of equal |br|
          or higher importance.
        - *enum*
        - ``warning``
        - ``info`` / ``warning`` / ``error``

    *   - Filter
        - ``filter``
        - Regex to filter the category  |br|
          or message of the logs.
        - *string*
        - info : ``DDSREPLAYER`` |br|
          warning : ``DDSPIPE|DDSREPLAYER`` |br|
          error : ``""``
        - Regex string
.. note::

    For the logs to function properly, the ``-DLOG_INFO=ON`` compilation flag is required.

The |ddsreplayer| prints the logs by default (warnings and errors in the standard error and infos in the standard output).
The |ddsreplayer|, however, can also publish the logs in a DDS topic.
To publish the logs, under the tag ``publish``, set ``enable: true`` and set a ``domain`` and a ``topic-name``.
The type of the logs published is defined as follows:

**LogEntry.idl**

.. code-block:: idl

    const long UNDEFINED = 0x10000000;
    const long SAMPLE_LOST = 0x10000001;
    const long TOPIC_MISMATCH_TYPE = 0x10000002;
    const long TOPIC_MISMATCH_QOS = 0x10000003;

    enum Kind {
      Info,
      Warning,
      Error
    };

    struct LogEntry {
      @key long event;
      Kind kind;
      string category;
      string message;
      string timestamp;
    };

.. note::

    The type of the logs can be published by setting ``publish-type: true``.

**Example of usage**

.. code-block:: yaml

    logging:
      verbosity: info
      filter:
        error: "DDSPIPE|FASTDDSSPY"
        warning: "DDSPIPE|FASTDDSSPY"
        info: "FASTDDSSPY"
      publish:
        enable: true
        domain: 84
        topic-name: "FastDdsSpyLogs"
        publish-type: false
      stdout: true
