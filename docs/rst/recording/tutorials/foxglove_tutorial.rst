Background
**********

This tutorial explains how to record data with DDS Recorder tool and visualize it with `Foxglove <https://foxglove.dev/>`_.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

It is required to have |eddsrecordreplay| previously installed using one of the following installation methods:

* :ref:`installation_manual_windows`
* :ref:`installation_manual_linux`
* :ref:`docker`

Additionally, `ShapesDemo <https://www.eprosima.com/index.php/products-all/eprosima-shapes-demo>`_ is required to publish and subscribe shapes of different colors and sizes.
The *ShapesDemo* application is already prepared to use Fast DDS DynamicTypes, which is required when using the DDS Recorder tool.
Install it by following any of the methods described in the given links:

* `Windows installation from binaries <https://eprosima-shapes-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/windows_binaries.html>`_
* `Linux installation from sources <https://eprosima-shapes-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux_sources.html>`_
* `Docker Image <https://eprosima-shapes-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/docker_image.html>`_

*************
Configuration
*************

The following YAML configuration file configures a recorder in domain ``0`` and save the output file as ``view_foxglove.mcap`` without timestamp.
