    :depth: 2


Dependencies installation
=========================

|eddsrecord| depends on *eProsima Fast DDS* library and certain Debian packages.
This section describes the instructions for installing |eddsrecord| dependencies and requirements in a Windows environment from sources.
The following packages will be installed:

- ``foonathan_memory_vendor``, an STL compatible C++ memory allocation library.
- ``fastcdr``, a C++ library that serializes according to the standard CDR serialization mechanism.
- ``fastrtps``, the core library of eProsima Fast DDS library.
- ``cmake_utils``, an eProsima utils library for CMake.
- ``cpp_utils``, an eProsima utils library for C++.
- ``ddspipe``, an eProsima internal library that enables the communication of DDS interfaces.

First of all, the :ref:`Requirements <windows_sources_requirements>` and :ref:`Dependencies <windows_sources_dependencies>` detailed below need to be met.
Afterwards, the user can choose whether to follow either the :ref:`colcon <windows_sources_colcon_installation>` or the :ref:`CMake <windows_sources_cmake_installation>` installation instructions.


.. _windows_sources_requirements:

Requirements
------------

The installation of *eProsima Fast DDS* in a Windows environment from sources requires the following tools to be installed in the system:

* :ref:`windows_sources_visual_studio`
* :ref:`windows_sources_chocolatey`
* :ref:`windows_sources_cmake_pip3_wget_git`
* :ref:`windows_sources_colcon_install` [optional]
* :ref:`windows_sources_fastddspython` [for remote controller only]
* :ref:`windows_sources_gtest` [for test only]

.. _windows_sources_visual_studio:

Visual Studio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>`_ is required to have a C++ compiler in the system. For this purpose, make sure to check the :code:`Desktop development with C++` option during the Visual Studio installation process.

If Visual Studio is already installed but the Visual C++ Redistributable packages are not, open Visual Studio and go to :code:`Tools` -> :code:`Get Tools and Features` and in the :code:`Workloads` tab enable :code:`Desktop development with C++`.
Finally, click :code:`Modify` at the bottom right.

.. _windows_sources_chocolatey:

Chocolatey
^^^^^^^^^^

Chocolatey is a Windows package manager. It is needed to install some of *eProsima Fast DDS*'s dependencies.
Download and install it directly from the `website <https://chocolatey.org/>`_.

.. _windows_sources_cmake_pip3_wget_git:

CMake, pip3, wget and git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These packages provide the tools required to install *eProsima Fast DDS* and its dependencies from command line.
Download and install CMake_, pip3_, wget_ and git_ by following the instructions detailed in the respective websites.
Once installed, add the path to the executables to the :code:`PATH` from the *Edit the system environment variables* control panel.

.. _windows_sources_colcon_install:

Colcon
^^^^^^

colcon_ is a command line tool based on CMake_ aimed at building sets of software packages.
Install the ROS 2 development tools (colcon_ and vcstool_) by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -U colcon-common-extensions vcstool

.. note::

    If this fails due to an Environment Error, add the :code:`--user` flag to the :code:`pip3` installation command.

.. _windows_sources_fastddspython:

Fast DDS Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`eProsima Fast DDS Python <https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-python/>`_ is a Python binding for the eProsima Fast DDS C++ library.
It is only required for the :ref:`remote controller application <remote_controller>`.

Clone the Github repository into the |eddsrecord| workspace and compile it with colcon_ as a dependency package.
Use the following command to download the code:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-python.git src/Fast-DDS-python

.. _windows_sources_gtest:

Gtest
^^^^^

Gtest is a unit testing library for C++.
By default, |eddsrecord| does not compile tests.
It is possible to activate them with the opportune `CMake options <https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/build.html#cmake-options>`_ when calling colcon_ or CMake_.
For more details, please refer to the :ref:`cmake_options` section.

Run the following commands on your workspace to install Gtest.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='C:\Program Files\gtest' -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON -DBUILD_GMOCK=ON ^
        -B build\gtest -A x64 -T host=x64 googletest
    cmake --build build\gtest --config Release --target install

or refer to the `Gtest Installation Guide <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_ for a detailed description of the Gtest installation process.

* :ref:`windows_sources_yamlcpp`
* :ref:`windows_sources_swig` [for remote controller only]
* :ref:`windows_sources_PyQt6` [for remote controller only]
* :ref:`windows_sources_mcap`
* :ref:`windows_sources_eprosima_dependencies`

.. _windows_sources_asiotinyxml2:

Asio and TinyXML2 libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level I/O programming, which provides a consistent asynchronous model.
TinyXML2 is a simple, small and efficient C++ XML parser.
They can be downloaded directly from the links below:

* `Asio <https://github.com/ros2/choco-packages/releases/download/2020-02-24/asio.1.12.1.nupkg>`_
* `TinyXML2 <https://github.com/ros2/choco-packages/releases/download/2020-02-24/tinyxml2.6.0.0.nupkg>`_

After downloading these packages, open an administrative shell with *PowerShell* and execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    choco install -y -s <PATH_TO_DOWNLOADS> asio tinyxml2

where :code:`<PATH_TO_DOWNLOADS>` is the folder into which the packages have been downloaded.

.. _windows_sources_openssl:

OpenSSL
^^^^^^^

OpenSSL is a robust toolkit for the TLS and SSL protocols and a general-purpose cryptography library.
Download and install the latest OpenSSL version for Windows at this `link <https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html>`_.
After installing, add the environment variable :code:`OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` pointing to the installation root directory.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64

.. _windows_sources_yamlcpp:

yaml-cpp
^^^^^^^^

``yaml-cpp`` is a YAML parser and emitter in C++ matching the YAML 1.2 spec, and is used by *DDS Recorder* application to parse the provided configuration files.
From an administrative shell with *PowerShell*, execute the following commands in order to download and install ``yaml-cpp`` for Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --branch yaml-cpp-0.7.0 https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='C:\Program Files\yamlcpp' -B build\yamlcpp yaml-cpp
   cmake --build build\yamlcpp --target install    # If building in Debug mode, add --config Debug

.. _windows_sources_mcap:

MCAP dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`MCAP <https://github.com/foxglove/mcap>`_ is a modular container format and logging library for pub/sub messages with arbitrary message serialization.
It is primarily intended for use in robotics applications, and works well under various workloads, resource constraints, and durability requirements.
MCAP C++ library is packed within |ddsrecorder| as a header-only, but its dependencies need to be installed using the appropriate Windows package manager.

It is recommended to use `vcpkg <https://vcpkg.io/en/>`__ dependency manager to install `LZ4 <https://github.com/lz4/lz4>`__ and `zstd <https://github.com/facebook/zstd>`__ dependencies.
Once both dependencies are installed, add the directory where the binaries are located to the ``PATH``. The installed binaries are usually located under ``<path\to\vcpkg>/\installed\x64-windows\bin`` directory.

.. _windows_sources_swig:

SWIG
^^^^

`SWIG <https://www.swig.org>`_ is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.
It is leveraged by :ref:`Fast DDS Python <fastdds_python>` to generate a Python wrapper over Fast DDS library.
SWIG is only a requirement for the :ref:`remote controller application <remote_controller>`.
It can be installed using the package manager of the appropriate Linux distribution.
For example, on Ubuntu use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install swig libpython3-dev

.. _windows_sources_PyQt6:

PyQt6
^^^^^

The |eddsrecord| remote controller is a graphical user interface application implemented in Python using `PyQt6 <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/>`__.
To install PyQt6 simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install PyQt6

.. _windows_sources_eprosima_dependencies:

eProsima dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If it already exists in the system an installation of *Fast DDS* and *DDS Pipe* libraries, just source this libraries when building the |eddsrecord| application by using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    source <fastdds-installation-path>/install/setup.bash
    source <ddspipe-installation-path>/install/setup.bash

In other case, just skip this step.


.. _windows_sources_colcon_installation:

Colcon installation (recommended)
=================================

.. important::

    Run colcon within a Visual Studio prompt.
    To do so, launch a *Developer Command Prompt* from the search engine.

#.  Create a :code:`DDS-Recorder` directory and download the :code:`.repos` file that will be used to install
    |eddsrecord| and its dependencies:

    .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir <path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Recorder
        cd <path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Recorder
        mkdir src
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eProsima/DDS-Recorder/main/ddsrecorder.repos --output-file ddsrecorder.repos
        vcs import src --input ddsrecorder.repos

    .. note::

        In case there is already a *Fast DDS* installation in the system it is not required to download and build
        every dependency in the :code:`.repos` file.
        It is just needed to download and build the |eddsrecord| project having sourced its dependencies.
        Refer to section :ref:`eprosima_dependencies` in order to check how to source *Fast DDS* library.

#.  Build the packages:

    .. code-block:: bash

        colcon build

.. note::

    To install both |ddsrecorder| and its :ref:`remote controller application <remote_controller>`, compilation flag ``-DBUILD_DDSRECORDER_CONTROLLER=ON`` is required.

.. note::

    Being based on CMake_, it is possible to pass the CMake configuration options to the :code:`colcon build` command.
    For more information on the specific syntax, please refer to the `CMake specific arguments <https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/build.html#cmake-specific-arguments>`_ page of the colcon_ manual.


.. _windows_sources_cmake_installation:

CMake installation
==================

This section explains how to compile |eddsrecord| with CMake_, either :ref:`locally <windows_sources_local_installation>` or :ref:`globally <windows_sources_global_installation>`.

.. _windows_sources_local_installation:

Local installation
------------------

#.  Open a command prompt, and create a :code:`DDS-Record` directory where to download and build |eddsrecord| and its dependencies:

.. note::

    By default, |eddsrecord| does not compile tests.
    However, they can be activated by downloading and installing `Gtest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_
    and building with CMake option ``-DBUILD_TESTS=ON``.


#.  Optionally, install the :ref:`remote controller application <remote_controller>` along with its dependency :ref:`Fast DDS Python <fastdds_python>`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Fast DDS Python
        cd <path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record
        mkdir build\fastdds_python
        cd build\fastdds_python
        cmake <path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record\src\Fast-DDS-python\fastdds_python -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record\install ^
            -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record\install
        cmake --build . --config Release --target install

        # Remote Controller Application
        cd <path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record
        mkdir build\controller_tool
        cd build\controller_tool
        cmake <path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record\src\controller\controller_tool -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record\install ^
            -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path\to\user\workspace>\DDS-Record\install -DBUILD_DDSRECORDER_CONTROLLER=ON
        cmake --build . --config Release --target install


.. _windows_sources_global_installation:

Global installation
-------------------

To install |eddsrecord| system-wide instead of locally, remove all the flags that appear in the configuration steps of :code:`Fast-CDR`, :code:`Fast-DDS`, :code:`Dev-Utils`, :code:`DDS-Pipe`, and :code:`DDS-Record`


Run an application
==================

If the |eddsrecord| was compiled using colcon, when running an instance of a |ddsrecorder|, the colcon overlay built in the dedicated :code:`DDS-Record` directory must be sourced.
There are two possibilities:

* Every time a new shell is opened, prepare the environment locally by typing the command:

  .. code-block:: bash

      setup.bat

* Add the sourcing of the colcon overlay permanently, by opening the *Edit the system environment variables* control panel, and adding the installation path to the :code:`PATH`.

However, when running an instance of a |ddsrecorder| compiled using CMake, it must be linked with its dependencies where the packages have been installed.
This can be done by opening the *Edit system environment variables* control panel and adding to the ``PATH`` the |eddsrecord|, *Fast DDS*, *Fast CDR*, *DDS Pipe* installation directories:

*   *Fast DDS*: ``C:\\Program Files\\fastrtps``
*   *Fast CDR*: ``C:\\Program Files\\fastcdr``
*   *DDS Pipe*: ``C:\\Program Files\\ddspipe``
*   |eddsrecord|: ``C:\\Program Files\\ddsrecord``
