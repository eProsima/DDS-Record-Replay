## Installation Guide

The instructions for installing the *DDS Recorder* application from sources and its required dependencies on a Linux
environment are provided below. These installation instructions are a summarized version of the complete
[installation guide](https://eprosima-dds-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/developer_manual/installation/sources/linux.html) available online. Instructions for installing *DDS Recorder* on a **Windows** platform can be found
[here](https://eprosima-dds-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/developer_manual/installation/sources/windows.html).

### Requirements

*eProsima DDS Recorder* requires the following tools to be installed in the system:
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) [optional, not required for CMake-only installation]
* [Gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) [for test only]
* [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) [for YAML Validator only]
* [jsonschema](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/) [for YAML Validator only]

#### CMake, g++, pip, wget and git

These packages provide the tools required to install DDS Recorder and its dependencies from command line. Install
[CMake](https://cmake.org/), [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) using the package manager of the appropriate Linux distribution. For
example, on Ubuntu use the command:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake g++ pip wget git
```

#### Colcon

[colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) is a command line tool based on [CMake](https://cmake.org/) aimed at building sets of software packages. Install the ROS 2 development tools ([colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) and [vcstool](https://pypi.org/project/vcstool/)) by executing the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -U colcon-common-extensions vcstool
```

If this fails due to an Environment Error, add the `--user` flag to the `pip3` installation command.

#### Gtest

[Gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) is a unit testing library for C++. By default, *DDS Recorder* does not
compile tests. It is possible to activate them with the opportune [CMake options](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/build.html#cmake-options) when calling [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) or
[CMake](https://cmake.org/). For a detailed description of the Gtest installation process, please refer to the
[Gtest Installation Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest).

#### PyYAML

[PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) is a YAML parser and emitter for Python.
It is used by the DDS-Recorder YAML Validator for loading the content of configuration files.
Install `pyyaml` by executing the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -U pyyaml
```

#### jsonschema

[jsonschema](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/) is an implementation of the JSON Schema specification for
Python.
It is used by the DDS-Recorder YAML Validator for performing validation of configuration files against a given JSON
schema.
Install `jsonschema` by executing the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -U jsonschema
```

### Dependencies

#### Asio and TinyXML2 libraries

Asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level I/O programming, which provides a consistent asynchronous
model. TinyXML2 is a simple, small and efficient C++ XML parser. Install these libraries using the package manager of
the appropriate Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu use the command:

```bash
sudo apt install libasio-dev libtinyxml2-dev
```

#### OpenSSL

[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is a robust toolkit for the TLS and SSL protocols and a general-purpose cryptography
library. Install OpenSSL using the package manager of the appropriate Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu use the
command:

```bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

#### yaml-cpp

[yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) parser and emitter in C++ matching the
[YAML 1.2 spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html), and is used by *DDS Recorder* application to parse the provided
configuration files. Install yaml-cpp using the package manager of the appropriate Linux distribution. For example, on
Ubuntu use the command:

```bash
sudo apt install libyaml-cpp-dev
```

#### eProsima dependencies

If it already exists in the system an installation of *Fast DDS* library with version greater than *2.4.0*, just source
this library when building the *DDS Recorder* application by using the command:

```bash
source <fastdds-installation-path>/install/setup.bash
```

In other case, just download *Fast DDS* project from sources and build it together with *DDS Recorder* using colcon as it
is explained in the following section.

### Colcon installation

1. Create a `DDS-Recorder` directory and download the `.repos` file that will be used to install *DDS Recorder* and its dependencies:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/DDS-Recorder/src
cd ~/DDS-Recorder
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eProsima/DDS-Recorder/main/ddsrecorder.repos
vcs import src < ddsrecorder.repos
```

2. Build the packages:

```bash
colcon build
```

This repository holds several colcon packages.
These packages are:

* `ddsrecorder_docs`: package to generate the DDS Recorder documentation using sphinx.

> *NOTE:* Those packages could be installed and use independently (according with each package dependency).
  In order to compile only a package and its dependencies, use the colcon argument `--packages-up-to <package>`.
  In order to explicitly skip some of these packages, use the colcon argument
  `--packages-skip <package1> [<package2> ...]`.

### Run an application

To run the *DDS Recorder* application, source the installation environment and execute the executable file that has been
installed in `<install-path>/ddsrecorder_tool/bin/ddsrecorder`:

```bash
# Source installation
source <install-path>/setup.bash

# Execute DDS Recorder
./<install-path>/ddsrecorder_tool/bin/ddsrecorder
```

### Testing

By default, *DDS Recorder* does not compile tests. However, they can be activated by downloading and installing
[Gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and building with CMake option `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON`. Once done, tests
can be run with the following command:

```bash
colcon test --packages-select-regex ddsrecorder --event-handler=console_direct+
```
